Computer Science 1081 – Assignment #03
Program #1
A movie theater only keeps a percentage of the revenue earned from ticket sales. The remainder goes to the movie distributor. Write a program that calculates a theater’s gross and net box office profit for a night. The program should ask for the name of the movie, and how many adult and child tickets were sold. (The price of an adult ticket is $10.00 and a child’s ticket is $6.00).
• Use constants for values that aren’t supplied by the user (such as the prices and profit margin)
Sample Execution:
Please enter the movie name: St. Patrick's Revenge
Please enter the number of adult tickets sold: 5621
Please enter the number of child tickets sold: 125
Movie Name:

Program #2
A retail company must file a monthly sales tax report listing the sales for the month and the amount of sales tax collected. Write a program that asks for the month, the year, and the total amount collected at the cash register (that is, sales plus sales tax). Assume the state sales tax is 4 percent and the county sales tax is 2 percent.
If the total amount collected is known and the total sales tax is 6 percent, the amount of product sales may be calculated as: S = (T/1.06). S is the product sales and T is the total income.
• Display the year next to the month as shown in the example below
• Use const for the tax rates
Sample Execution:
Please enter the Month: January
Please enter the year: 2017
Please enter the total amount collected: $482
Month: January 2017

Program #3
Assuming there are no deposits other than the original investment, the balance in a savings account after one year may be calculated as: Amount = Principal * (1 + (Rate/T))^T. Principal is the balance in the savings account, Rate is the interest rate, and T is the number of times the interest is compounded during a year (T is 4 if the interest is compounded quarterly). Write a program that asks for the principal, the interest rate, and the number of times the interest is compounded.
Sample Execution:
Please enter the Principal Balance: $30284
Please enter the interest rate (as a decimal): 0.03
Please enter the number of times interest is compounded: 120
