//Huan Chen Assignment 05 Program 01 only using while loops
// Program #1 & #2 (NOTE: TWO DIFFERENT PROGRAMS)
// The distance a vehicle travels can be calculated as follows: distance = speed * time. For example, if a train travels 40 miles per hour for 3 hours, the distance traveled is 120 miles.
// Write a program that asks the user for the speed of a vehicle (in miles per hours) and how many hours it has traveled. The program should then use a loop to display the distance the vehicle has traveled for each hour of that time period. Do not accept a negative number for speed and do not accept any value less than 1 for time traveled.
// • Program #1: Write only using while loops
// • Program #2: Write only using do-while loops
// • Program should loop until the user enters correct data [INPUT VALIDATION]
// Sample Output:
// What is the speed of the vehicle in mph? 50
// How many hours has it traveled? -4
// How many hours has it traveled? 4
// Hour  Distance Traveled
// -------------------------------
// 1 50
// 2 100
// 3 150
// 4 200
