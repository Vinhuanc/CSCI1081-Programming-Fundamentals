Computer	Science	1081	– Assignment	#05
Program	#1 &	#2 (NOTE:	TWO	DIFFERENT	PROGRAMS)
The	distance	a	vehicle	travels	can	be	calculated	as	follows:	distance	=	speed	*	time.		For	
example,	if	a	train	travels	40	miles	per	hour	for	3	hours,	the	distance	traveled	is	120	miles.		
Write	a	program	that	asks	the	user	for	the	speed	of	a	vehicle	(in	miles	per	hours)	and	how	many	
hours	it	has	traveled.		The	program	should	then	use	a	loop	to	display	the	distance	the	vehicle	
has	traveled	for	each	hour	of	that	time	period.		Do	not	accept	a	negative	number	for	speed	and	
do	not	accept	any	value	less	than	1	for	time	traveled.
• Program	#1:	Write	only	using	while	loops
• Program	#2:	Write	only	using	do-while	loops
• Program	should	loop	until	the	user	enters	correct	data [INPUT	VALIDATION]
Sample	Output:
What is the speed of the vehicle in mph? 50
How many hours has it traveled? -4
How many hours has it traveled? 4
Hour Distance Traveled
-------------------------------
 1 50
 2 100
 3 150
 4 200

Program	#3
Write	a	program	that	calculates	how	much	a	person	would	earn	over	a	period	of	time	if	his	or	
her	salary	is	one	penny	the	first	day	and	two	pennies	the	second	day,	and	continues	to	double	
each	day.		The	program	should	ask	the	user	for	the	number	of	days.		Display	the	table	showing	
how	much	the	salary	was	for	each	day,	and	then	show	the	total	pay	at	the	end	of	the	period.		
The	output	should	be	displayed	in	a	dollar	amount,	not	the	number	of	pennies.		Do	not	accept	a	
number	less	than	1	for	the	number	of	days	worked.	
• Use	a	do-while	loop	for	input	validation
• Use	a	for	loop	to	calculate	the	pay	increase	and	display	the	table
Sample	Output:
For how many days will the pay double? 6
Day Total Pay
---------------------
 1 $ 0.01
 2 $ 0.02
 3 $ 0.04
 4 $ 0.08
 5 $ 0.16
 6 $ 0.32
---------------------
Total $ 0.63

Program	#4
Write	a	program	that	uses	nested	loops	to	collect	data	and	calculate	the	average	rainfall	over	a	
period	of	years.		The	program	should	first	ask	for	the	number	of	years.		The	outer	loop	will	
iterate	once	for	each	year.		The	inner	loop	will	iterate	twelve	times,	once	for	each	month.		Each	
iteration	of	the	inner	loop	will	ask	for	the	inches	of	rainfall	for	that	month.	
After	all	iterations,	the	program	should	display	the	number	of	months,	the	total	inches	of	
rainfall,	and	the	average	rainfall	per	month	for	the entire	period.		Do	not	accept	a	number	less	
than	1	for	the	number	of	years.		Do	not	accept	negative	number	for	the	monthly	rainfall.
• Input	validation	not	required
• Only	use	for	loops	and	nested	loops	for	computation
• Use	a	const for	the	number	of	months	in	the	year.	(for	ease	of	testing	interactively,	
consider	a	calendar	with	only	4	months	in	a	year,	your	program	should	be	able	to	work	
by	just	changing	this	constant)
Sample	Output:
This program will calculate average rainfall over a
period of years. How many years do you wish to average? 2
Year 1
Number of inches of rain for month 1? 4
Number of inches of rain for month 2? 5
Number of inches of rain for month 3? 6
Number of inches of rain for month 4? 7
Number of inches of rain for month 5? 8
Number of inches of rain for month 6? 9
Number of inches of rain for month 7? 1
Number of inches of rain for month 8? 2
Number of inches of rain for month 9? 3
Number of inches of rain for month 10? 4
Number of inches of rain for month 11? 5
Number of inches of rain for month 12? 6
Year 2
Number of inches of rain for month 1? 7
Number of inches of rain for month 2? 8
Number of inches of rain for month 3? 9
Number of inches of rain for month 4? 4
Number of inches of rain for month 5? 5
Number of inches of rain for month 6? 6
Number of inches of rain for month 7? 7
Number of inches of rain for month 8? 8
Number of inches of rain for month 9? 9
Number of inches of rain for month 10? 1
Number of inches of rain for month 11? 2
Number of inches of rain for month 12? 3
Over a period of 24 months, 129 inches of rain fell.
Average monthly rainfall for the period is 5.375 inches.
