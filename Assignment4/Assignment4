Program	#1	
Write	a	program	that	asks	the	user	to	enter	a	number	within	the	range	of	1	through	10.		Use	a	
switch	statement	to	display	the	Roman	numeral	version	of	that	number.		Do	not	accept	a	
number	less	than	1	or	greater	than	10.	
• Use	a	switch statement
• Make	sure	that	you	tell	the	user	if	their	input	is	not	accepted
Sample	Outputs:
Enter a number (1-10): 5
The Roman numeral version of 5 is V

Program	#2
A	software	company	sells	a	package	that	retails	for	$99.		Quantity	discounts	are	given	according	
to	the	following	table:
Quantity Discount
10-19 20%
20-49 30%
50-99 40%
100	or	more 50%
Write	a	program	that	asks	for	the	number	of	units	sold	and	computes	the	total	cost	of	the	
purchase.		Make	sure	the	number	of	units	is	greater	than	0.
• Use	only	the	if	statement,	don’t	use	a	switch or	else block
• Note: the	auto-checker	on	this	program	does	take	some	time	(a	few	seconds on	the	college’s	
computers)	to	process	the	code	checks
Sample	Outputs:
How many units were sold? 48
The total cost of the purchase is $3326.40
Press any key to continue . . .
========================================
How many units were sold? -1
Error: Units sold must be positive integer

Test	the	boundaries:	does	the	result	match	expectations	when	you	are	1	unit	below, and	1	
unit above	the	threshold	(e.g.	Quantity	9	and	10,	getting	the	correct	discount	values)
Program	#3
A	bank	charges	$10	per	month	plus	the	following	check	fees	for	a	commercial	checking	account:
$0.10	each	for	fewer	than	20	checks
$0.08	each	for	20-39	checks
$0.06	each	for	40-59	checks
$0.04	each	for	60	or	more	checks
The	bank	also	charges	an	extra	$15	if	the	balance	of	the	account	falls	below	$400	(before	any	
check	fees	are	applied).		Write	a	program	that	asks	for	the	beginning	balance	and	the	number	
of	checks	written.		Compute	and	display	the	bank’s	service	fees	for	the	month.		Do	not	accept	a	
negative	value	for	the	number	of	checks written.		If a	negative	value	is	given	for	the	beginning	
balance,	display	and	urgent	message	indicating	the	account	is	overdrawn.
• Use	only	the	if	statement
• No	message	needs	to	be	displayed	if	the	account	balance	falls	below	the	$400	threshold,	
just	add	the	appropriate	fee	into	the	total.
• For	the	overdrawn	balance	portion	of	the	problem,	determine	if	the	fee	will	overdraw	
the	account.		However, display	the	message	about	overdrawing	the	account	before	
displaying	what	the	fees	are.		For	example,	if	the	account	has	$9.99	and	the	fees	will	
total	to	$10,	the	account	will	be	overdrawn.	
Sample	Outputs:
Enter the following information about your checking account
Beginning balance: $1562
Number of checks written: 20
The bank fee this month is $11.60
Press any key to continue . . .
========================================
Enter the following information about your checking account
Beginning balance: $10
Number of checks written: 2
Your account is overdrawn!
The bank fee this month is $25.20

Program	#4
Write	a	program	that	displays	the	following	menu	(see	below).	
- If	the	user	enters	1,	the	program	should	ask	for	the	radius	of	the	circle	and	then	display	its	
area.		Use	the	formula	area	=	pi*r^2.		Use	3.14159	for	pi	and	the	radius	of	the	circle	for	r.	
- If	the	user	enters	2,	the	program	should	ask	for	the	length	and width	of	the	rectangle	and	then	
display	he	rectangle’s	area.		Use	the	formula	area	=	length	*	width.
- If	the	user	enters	3,	the	program	should	ask	for	the	length	of	the	triangle’s	base	and	its	
height,	and	then	display	is	area.		Use	the	formula	area	=	base	*	height	*	(1/2).
- If	the	user	enters	4,	the	program	should	end
- Display	an	error	message	if	the	user	enters	a	number	outside	the	range	of	1	through	4	when	
selecting	an	item	from	the	menu.		Do	not	accept	negative	values	for	the	circle’s	radius,	the	
rectangle’s	length	or	width,	or	the	triangle’s	base	or	height.
• Use	a	switch statement	to	evaluate	the	user	menu	choice
• Do	input	validation	for	the	correct	menu	choice
• Define	Pi	as	a	constant	to	5 decimal	places	(3.14159)
